When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you collaborate with people, or work on different machines, or as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stau up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you don't want to push/pull broken code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one insted of the other?

Branches exist withon a repository, clones are copies of a repository
and forks are copies of a repository in GitHub.
Use branches to implement a new feature, clone to have a local copy
to work on and fork to work on a repository for which you don't have 
write permission.
