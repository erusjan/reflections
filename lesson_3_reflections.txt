When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you collaborate with people, or work on different machines, or as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stau up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you don't want to push/pull broken code.
