What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize the repository, git creates a .git directory.
This enables git to work with the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?What value do you think it offers?

The staging area consists of files scheduled to be committed. It enables you
to preview the commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit 
per logical change?

You add what you want to the staging area (with the git add command)
and then git commit will commit just that and nothing else.
